        <p>Davy Jones was born in Manchester, England. At the age of 21 from 1966 to 1971, 
        Jones became a member of The Monkees and was the only Monkee
        to sign a deal with the studio. He sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings,
        including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer". The ever talented Jones was also a

        <p class="card-text">Drums &amp; Vocals</p>
        <p>Micky Dolenz had his own group called "Micky and the One-Nighters" with himself
        as lead singer. His band's live stage act included rock songs, cover songs, and even
        R&B. His favourite was a classic Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode", the song Dolenz
        chose to sing for his first Monkees audition. He self taught himself to play the drums and loved playing
        them in the band with passion.</p>

        <h3>Michael Nesmith</h3>
        <p class="card-text">Guitar &amp; Vocals</p>
        <p>Michael Nesmith was originally born in Houston. As he grew, his passion for music led
        him to land the role as the wool-hat-wearing guitar player "Mike" in the show, which 
        required real-life musical talent (writing, instrument playing, singing, recording, and 
        performing in live concerts as part of The Monkees musical band). Mike is an excellent musician.</p>

        <h3>Peter Tork</h3>
        <p class="card-text">Bass Guitar &amp; Vocals</p>
        <p>Peter Tork was born in Washington, D.C. in 1942. Tork was the oldest member of
        the group and was a proficient musician, and though the group was not allowed to play 
        their own instruments on their first two albums, he was an exception, playing what he
        described as "third chair guitar" on Mike Nesmith's song, "Papa Gene's Blues," 
        from their first album.</p>
