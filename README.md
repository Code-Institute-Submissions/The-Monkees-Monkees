<h1>The Monkees Website</h1>

<h2>Website GitHub pages</h2>

<p>The project I’ve designed is my first milestone project for the User Centric Frontend Development module of the Full Stack Developer Course. 
I’ve used some HTML as the main backbone layout for the page along with functionality and elements from bootstrap and CSS. The page consists 
of 4 main pages including a Home page, a Merchandise page a Touring page and a Contact Us page.</p>

<p>It includes a video of the band performing one of their songs. Information about the band and their members. Where you can see them playing 
live and how you can contact them if you wanted to book them to perform. There’s also interactive content and links to their own Monkees sites 
so you can review them in their genuine environment and not just the mockup site.

<H3>How I’d like the website to be perceived:</H3>

•	A site that can be viewed by old and new fans for everyone to enjoy

•	A source of material where you can find out about the band, where they’re playing and how you can interact with them.

•	Nice UX design that is easy to follow, engaging for a user to understand and follow. 

<h3>Home Page</h3>

On the Home Page, a striking black and white image of the band performing is displayed with page links at the top with white lettering. 
Below the image are 4 individual paragraphs and buttons underneath each one. The paragraphs are inline with their band members and contains
a short piece of information about the band member. The button underneath displays the members names and clicking on each button displays 
a modal card with an image of that band member and some more information. You'll notice when clicking on the modal button, along with the
image, there's colour to the background and a close button.

Further down below the band paragraphs, there’s a playable video of their unmistakable classic hit ‘Daydream Believer’ which was one of 
their biggest songs. As a colourful video, it stands out so you focus and watch the video without distraction.

Then at the very bottom there are various social media links which take you to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages respectively.
The link images are from Font Awesome and are on each page for consistency.

<h3>Our Merchandise</h3>

This page again has the large black and white image with the black and white nav bar. Below the image, we have 8 individual paragraphs
in 2 lines of 4. Each each paragraph, there's an image of either a record or a poster that can be purchased. There's also an Order button
which when clicked, a Modal card is displayed with an image of the record or poster. For the records, there's a track listing and for the 
posters, there are sizes in which you can get a copy of the print for your wall or as a post card. The record modal boxes are displayed with
blue background to match their blue 'Order Here' buttons and the posters Modal card have a green background to match their green 'Order Here'
buttons. Below these 8 images, there is again the social medial links with the Font Awesome icons.

<h3>Get in Touch</h3>

A page designed so that the fans can contact the band for either a booking or just to say Hi!! 

Underneath the black and white image, there's a grid system set of 3. On the left, there's a paragraph with some info about the band and a blue
booking form. Clicking on here brings up fully functional booking form within a Modal card. You can add an email address, choose how many hours 
you'd like the band to play. You can choose the event such as a wedding or a party and also add extra imformation before submitting.

Then a colourful image of the band in their youthful days which I named 'Pastel colours' which stand out in the centre of the page. Then, there's
third column with a message from the band. They love to hear from their fans and using the 'Get In Touch' button, you can do that to send a message
and say hello. Tell them how their music speaks to you and how you've been a fan of this outstanding band. The social media links complete the page.

<h3>Touring</h3>

This band has been touring for over 50 years and even as a twosome, they still have the passion to do it. The usual image spreads across the page
below the Navigation bar and below the image sits 3 columns again. Staying consistent with the rest of the page, there's 2 paragraphs of information
on each side of an image of the band playing live. Below the paragraphs, there's 2 Modal content buttons. Clicking on the 'Australian Tour Dates' 
button brings up a Modal card of their Australina dates and the same can be show in Blue for the 'American Tour Dates' 
Again, each Modal card has a blue and a green background to tie into their respective buttons and staying the same throughout the website.

<h3>Hopes for the website are:</h3>

I made the website for the fans and tried to make it look up to date with easy to use functionality. I also like to think it could be a good base 
platform website as you can link here and then go on to other pages to find more in depth information, opportunities to purchase memorabilia and 
follow the band as the remaining members continue to tour. I wanted the site to be easy to use for all users of all ages and so:

•	Showcase the band 

•	Allow the user to follow them, purchase items or arrange private bookings

•	Nice design that allows each user to move around the site comfortably. This is designed for fans of all ages.

•	Clean, clear and easy to use.




UX

Using a scrolling image method with a fixed element, the band is shown in all their glory in black and white as the initial 
image and as you scroll down each page, you can find out more and look at products regarding the band.

My initial design was all done by hand with a layout in mind. When I first started my project and spoke to my Mentor, I had 
various ideas of how I wanted the page to look with a strong background image to showcase the look of the band. Showing 
togetherness and them performing at the height of their career. The black and white image provided for the course I found 
to be perfect, it’s clean, crisp and there seems to be passion behind the photo. 

The movement of the page is subtle but sharp and the static image against a moving page adds a professional element to the site. 

I wanted the site to be easy to use for all users of all ages. The Monkees will always have older fans naturally due to when 
they were popular and so this site has been developed with that in mind. A user could easily find their way around and the 
page isn’t overloaded with information. There’s short simple info about the band members for the users but the option to 
find out more is available via links to the 4 guy’s Wikipedia pages. Newer fans can use these links to get to each page, 
you can go to the YouTube, Facebook and Twitter pages to find tour dates, hear their music and purchase merchandise direct.

Site Interactivity and Features

The site has some interactivity linking to other sites and a music video that you can watch.

Languges Used

I used elements of HTML for the main body of the site. I used some CSS to link the media pages and bootstrap for some of the content.


The more in depth information for the home page for the band linked to the band members Wikipedia pages:

Media

The music video and images used within the site were all provided through the course I’m studying.

Acknowledgements

The Wikipedia pages and social media sites are dedicated to the band and I’m grateful they were available as they allowed my page to 
be a good platform to start a fans love for the Monkees.
