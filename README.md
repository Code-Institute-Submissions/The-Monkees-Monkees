The Monkess – The Band
The project I’ve designed is my first milestone project for User Centric Frontend Development. I’ve used some HTML as the main backbone layout for the page along with functionality and elements from bootstrap and CSS. The page consists of 3 main pages including a Home page, a Merchandise page and a Contact Us page. The source material provided asked for a site to made about the popular 60’s band, The Monkees. As the project requires some interactive content, I’ve added links to more in depth biographies of the band members and also, actual working links to their official Facebook and YouTube pages.
Using a scrolling image method with a fixed element, the band is shown in all their glory in black and white as the initial image and as you scroll down each page, you can find out more and look at products regarding the band.
UX
My initial design was all done by hand with a layout in mind. When I first started my project and spoke to my Mentor, I had various ideas of how I wanted the page to look with a strong background image to showcase the look of the band. Showing togetherness and them performing at the height of their career. The black and white image provided for the course I found to be perfect, it’s clean, crisp and there seems to be passion behind the photo. 
The movement of the page is subtle but sharp and the static image against a moving page adds a professional element to the site. On the Home Page, as soon as you land, you hear the unmistakable classic hit ‘Daydream Believer’ which was one of their biggest songs and the colourful video stands out so you focus and watch the video without distraction.
I’ve made the website for the fans and tried to make it look up to date but functional. I also like to think it could be a good base platform website as you can link here and then go on to other pages to find more in depth information, opportunities to purchase memorabilia and follow the band as the remaining members continue to tour.
I wanted the site to be easy to use for all users of all ages. The Monkees will always have older fans naturally due to when they were popular and so this site has been developed with that in mind. A user could easily find their way around and the page isn’t overloaded with information. There’s short simple info about the band members for the users but the option to find out more is available via links to the 4 guy’s Wikipedia pages. Newer fans can use these links to get to each page, you can go to the YouTube, Facebook and Twitter pages to find tour dates, hear their music and purchase merchandise direct.
Site Interactivity and Features
The site has some interactivity linking to other sites and a music video that you can watch.
Languges Used
I used elements of HTML for the main body of the site. I used some CSS to link the media pages and bootstrap for some of the content.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
1.	Contact form:
i.	Go to the "Contact Us" page
ii.	Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
iii.	Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
iv.	Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
