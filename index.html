        <h3>Micky Dolenz</h3>
        <p>Micky Dolenz originally had his own group called "Micky and the One-Nighters" with himself as lead singer. 
He had penned at least one or two tunes of his own at the time. His band's live stage 
act included rock songs, cover songs, and even some R&B. He loved to sing
Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode" which was the song Dolenz sang at his Monkees audition, 
resulting in his being hired. Not originally a drummer, he was taught and became excellent with the sticks.</p>
