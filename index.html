          Jones became a member of The Monkees and was the only Monkee
          to sign a deal with the studio. He sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings,
          including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer". The ever talented Jones was also a

         their own instruments on their first two albums, he was an exception, playing what he
         described as "third chair guitar" on Mike Nesmith's song, "Papa Gene's Blues,"
